				<h2>Matthew Garza</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Matthew Garza and I am currently seeking my MAGeo in Geographic Information Science. I received my BS in Physical Geography from Texas State in 2013 and started my MAGeo in 2014. I have been on a 3-year hiatus from grad school while working at Texas State University. My research interest align with GIS and water resources. Specifically groundwater vulnerability and flood management. I am also interested in utilizing front end web development including JavaScript, HTML, and Python to help solve geospatial problems.
