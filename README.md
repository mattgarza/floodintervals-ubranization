Leveraging social media to track disaster damage from flood events in Central Texas 
====

This project aims to leverage social media to map the impact of floods of different recurrence intervals in Central Texas. A flood map will be created for each event using volunteered geospatial data from Twitter and flooding possibility based on water height from tweets and USGS Stream flow data stations. The idea is to create near real time estimation of flooding in the future that can improve the situational awareness during a flooding event in Central Texas to inform and support decision making of local communities and emergency first responders.
